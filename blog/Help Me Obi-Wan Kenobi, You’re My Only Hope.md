When I was about 12 or so I wanted to make a real hologram by using multiple projectors like this https://retronom.hu/node/9078. So I gathered a couple of friends from school. I noticed that these projectors eat the same film roll format as the ones needed in our analog camera. The camera that took those shitty red-eye 90's family photos, everybody in all jeans all the time, because it's right after the change of regimes in Hungary.

We also got the original film rolls back when we went to the photo shop to develop the films. The image was in negative but it's ok. I thought if I take a picture from an apple from multiple angles, I feed the negative rolls into multiple projectors, try to position the projectors roughly at the same positions as the camera were when taking the corresponding image then I can project a negative colored apple into 3D. Of course I need some sort of material to project onto so I can actually see something.

Luckily I knew how to generate white smoke.
