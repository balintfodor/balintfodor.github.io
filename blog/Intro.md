Hey kids, this is dad. You are pretty young now but I'm writing this blog for you. I'm gonna talk about my ideas, big and small learnings. Things that you might want to avoid in your future that I could not avoid. Things that might inspire you, give a boost. Or just dump things out of my mind. When I'm writing to you beans, it feels it has a bigger purpose, so you're kind of my motivators.

I heard a podcast interview recently with JL Collins who mentioned that he started writing his book for his daughter. I thought it's a wonderful idea and driver so I can use my kids as my driver for this too.

We're not native english speakers so you're not yet able to read this. As a matter of fact you don't read yet.

Lately I'm pretty interested in starting a business, side hustle or project that is my own, that I build and run. That can generate money, quit my full-time job, take more control over my schedule so I can have more time for you kids when I'm needed. Also to possibly have something I can pass onto you if you want.

All right, it's also for me. Mainly for me. To experience building, discovering uncharted territories, to explore, to play, be creative.

When I got a NES from my parents at age 6-7, I was amazed. The first game I had was Super Mario 3. Looked so cool. I decided I want to be a Nintendo game developer when I grow up. I remember somehow opening a cartridge and gazing at the chips and circuits, trying to figure out what they might be and how the designers got to do what those electronics do.

I liked disassembling things, looking at how they might work, what's the inner mechanism. Putting back together is a different story, there's always one screw that eventually got left out.

Anyway, I'm a software engineer now, I like building things. I'm fascinated by the fields of 3D graphics, 3D reconstruction and all sorts of related things that process or produce images. Not really a Nintendo game dev though. Maybe some day.
